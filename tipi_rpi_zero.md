# How to get TIPI on Raspberry PI Zero W working with MiSter via USER Port.
These instructions are how to modify a TIPI install to be used on a Raspberry PI Zero W with the MiSter's User Port.
This is NOT necessary for Raspberry PI 3 and above.

- SSH to Tipi
- Login with default username/password (tipi/tipi)
- `cd /tipi/services/libtipi`
- `vi tipiports.c` (or `nano tipiports.c` for the non-vi folks)
	- Goto line 55 (`:55` in vi, `CTRL+-` in Nano)
	- uncomment this line:
		  `// delayMicroseconds(1L);`  
      to look like this:  
		   `delayMicroseconds(1L);`
- Write/Save changes and exit (`:wq` in vi, `CTRL+X,` answer `Y` to save changes, press `Enter` on filename to keep same filename)
- `./rebuild.sh`
	- During build process, you'll see a bunch of warnings, it's safe to ignore them.
- `sudo reboot`
